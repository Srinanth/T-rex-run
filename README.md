# 🐉 T-Rex Run: Samurai & Dragons Edition

A beautifully revamped version of the classic Chrome Dino game — now featuring a T-Rex sprinting through an endless land of **samurai obstacles** and **flying dragons**, all set against a **scenic animated background**.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept

> **Consistency is key.**

Unlike the traditional game that ramps up difficulty with speed, this game challenges players to **maintain a steady rhythm**. The difficulty stays **constant throughout**, but even the slightest break in concentration can cost you the run.

- **No sudden spikes in challenge.**
- **Pure focus and timing.**
- **Infinite run — progress depends solely on your ability to stay consistent.**

## 🦖 Features

- **T-Rex Player:** Classic dino never looked cooler.
- **Samurai Obstacles:** Replaces the old cactus, bringing action and a stylish twist.
- **Dragon Enemies:** Soar and dodge, replacing birds with fire-breathing dragons.
- **Dynamic Background:** An aesthetically pleasing background that enhances immersion.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Smooth Animations & Controls:** Designed for a clean, lag-free experience.
